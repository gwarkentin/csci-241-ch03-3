WeekDays_Symbolic_Constants

This is a practice with symbolic constant definitions either using integers or strings. The following three parts are required to implement:
1. Define symbolic constants:

; For 7 days of the week, defines symbolic names of integers to simulate C enumeration type: 
nMonday     ...
nTuesday    ...
nWednesday  ...
nThursday   ...
nFriday     ...
nSaturday   ...
nSunday     ...

; For Monday and Tuesday, define 2 symbolic names for string:
sMonday     ...
sTuesday    ...
2. In data segment, create following variables to use above symbols as initializers. Then use $ operator to calculate count and size here:

   ; Create a BYTE array that uses integer symbols as initializers
   bWeekDays ...
   ; Calculate the number of elements in bWeekDays
   bWeekDaysCount ...

   ; Create a DWORD array that uses integer symbols as initializers
   dWeekDays ...
   ; Calculate the number of elements in dWeekDays
   dWeekDaysCount ...

   ; Create a string variable that uses text symbol for Monday as initializers
   strMon ...
   ; Calculate the size of strMon
   strMonSize ...

   ; Create a string variable that uses text symbol for Tuesday as initializers 
   strTue ...
   ; Calculate the size of strTue
   strTueSize ...

   DWORD 12345678h ; Ending flag
3. In code segment, set a break point when running in debug. Watch your memory to verify:

   ; Move BYTE array count to a register to verify 7 for bWeekDay
   mov ...

   ; Move DWORD array count to a register to verify 7 for dWeekDays
   mov ...

   ; Move Monday variable size to a register to make it 7 as required
   mov ...

   ; Move Tuesday variable size to a register to make it 12 as required
   mov ...
When test your program in debugger and enter &bWeekDays, the result would be like this:

where two series of 1 to 7 are bWeekDay and dWeekDays, 4d 6f 6e 64 61 79 00 for Monday. Notice that 0d 0a 54 75 65 73 64 61 79 0d 0a 00 is the required result to achieve its size 12 (0Ch) with two new lines and a zero terminator.
- You can define a new line and zero terminator either in symbols or variables.
